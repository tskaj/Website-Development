        ❝The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known
        defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found
        their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a
        sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with
        compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do
        not just happen.❞
