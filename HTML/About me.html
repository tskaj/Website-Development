        <h1>Zaeema Ahmad, PhD, RP</h1>
        <p>
          I hold a PhD. degree in Clinical Psychology and have been involved in
          the field of mental health (academics, research, and clinical
          practice) with +15 years of working experience in diverse settings
          including hospital, universities and private practice. I provide
          psychotherapy and counselling to adults, youth, and couples/families
          experiencing diverse range of challenges associated with mental
          health. My approach to therapy is client centered, collaborative, and
          trauma informed. Therapy is not ‘one size fits all’. I integrate a
          variety of modalities for treatment including Cognitive-behavior
          therapy, Mindfulness based therapies, Solution focused therapy,
          Dialectical Behavior therapy and Narrative approaches to understand
          your life experiences, develop and implement short and long-term
          goals, and help you meet your needs. I believe each individual is
          unique and has a capacity to grow to their fullest potential. I value
          providing a safe, compassionate and nonjudgmental environment, and
          support you to become aware of your feelings, thoughts and behaviors,
          identify obstacles, and work towards achieving your goals.
